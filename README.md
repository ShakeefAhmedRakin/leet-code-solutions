# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This is where I track my problem-solving journey, enhance my algorithmic thinking, and strengthen my data structure knowledge. I'm following the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) as a structured guide, while also exploring other LeetCode problems outside the roadmap.

## Repository Structure

### 1. [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) Solutions 🗺️

**Folder:** `neetcode`

- This folder contains solutions to problems outlined in the NeetCode Roadmap.
- The roadmap focuses on foundational topics and patterns across various categories, including Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.
- Each problem is solved with clear, efficient code and includes comments for better understanding.

**Example Structure:**

```
/neetcode
├── Arrays & Hashing
│   ├── contains_duplicate.js
│   ├── valid_anagram.js
│   └── ...
├── Two Pointers
│   ├── valid_palindrome.js
│   ├── trapping_rain_water.js
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
